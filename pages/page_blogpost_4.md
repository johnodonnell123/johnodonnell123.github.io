# Similarity Measures

**Description:** In this post I want to share some of the takeaways I've found to be interesting concerning customer churn and the impact it has on a subscription business.

# What is churn?
Customer churn is when a service provider loses a customer. For example, let us say Hulu had 1 million customers at the beginning of the month, and of that 1 million 50,000 cancelled their subscription and are no longer customers. These 50,000 customers are said to have "churned", and the churn rate for this month would be 5%. 50,000 customers *feels* like a large number, however that is a common churn rate to see in any subscription business!

There are a few things I would like to cover in this post that I have found impactful:
- How churn relates to customer tenure (how long the average customer remains a customer)
- How churn relates to LTV (the total value of each customer)
- Churn and LTV : CAC (an important financial metric for valuing subscription businesses)
- Churn and growth


**The takeaway from this post is to better understand the impact of churn on the business as a whole. Having an in depth understanding of churn means understanding your users and your business, allowing for more efficient solutions to be implemented and continued growth.**
