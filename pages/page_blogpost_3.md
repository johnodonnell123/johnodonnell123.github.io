# Understanding the impact of customer churn

**Description:** In this post I want to share some of the takeaways I've found to be interesting concerning customer churn and the impact it has on a business. . 

### What is churn?
Customer churn is when a service provider loses a customer. For example, let's say Netflix had 1 million customers at the beginning of the month, and of that 1 million 70,000 cancelled thier subscription and are no longer customers. There 70,000 customer are said to have "churned", and the churn rate for this particular month would be 7%. 70,000 customers *feels* like a very large number, however that is a very common churn rate to see in any subscriptoin business!

There are a few things I would like to cover in this post that I've found interesting:
- How churn relates to customer tenure (how long the average customer remains a customer)
- How churn relates to LTV
- How churn relates to growth
